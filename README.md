# 6.4-Backbone-Exercises
Description: 
I built 5 separate projects using MVC architecture, specifically Backbone.  Each project was scaffolded using yeoman.

a) Form that saves a blog post (title and body) to tiny-lasagna-server.

b) Form that creates a person. Incorporates a first name, last name, address, and phone number. 
Saves the person to tiny-lasagna-server.

c) A "blog reading app", where you have a list of blog posts on the side and when you click on a post title, it opens 
that post in another view. 

d) A bookmarking app where user can save URLs. Incorporates a form where user can enter the URL, title, and a "tag".
There is a list of all the URLs, as well as a list of all the tags. When the user clicks on a tag, 
the link list shows only those tags. 

e) A complete blog CMS from scratch, allowing user to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
